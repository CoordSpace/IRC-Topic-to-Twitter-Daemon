# This class is dedicated to the extraction of information from specially
# formatted IRC topic strings and the creation of concise messages
# It is inherently single use and relies on a specific set of unwritten
# topic formatting standards that only exist on the #dopefish_lives IRC channel
# Due to this inflexible nature, I do not recommend using this fork of the
# twitter daemon unless you can adopt some conventions:

# In the original usage, this script extracts the first two elements from
# a topic string formatted as shown:
#     Streamer: <item one> | Game: <item 2> | Useless information that
#     gets removed -> <item one> is playing <item two>! Come watch @ Dopelives.com
#  or
#     Movienight: Stream info here | Any | number | of | segments ->
#     Movienight: Stream info here | Any | number | of | segments

# If you stick to those conventions and change any specifics to the
# Dopelives community, this fork will work out just fine for your uses. :)
