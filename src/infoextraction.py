"""
    This class is dedicated to the extraction of information from specially
    formatted IRC topic strings and the creation of concise messages
    It is inherently single use and relies on a specific set of unwritten
    topic formatting standards that only exist on the #dopefish_lives IRC channel
    Due to this inflexible nature, I do not recommend using this fork of the
    twitter daemon unless you can adopt some conventions:

    In the original usage, this script extracts the first two elements from
    a topic string formatted as shown:
        Streamer: <item one> | Game: <item 2> | Useless information that
        gets removed -> <item one> is playing <item two>! Come watch @ Dopelives.com
     or
        Movienight: Stream info here | Any | number | of | segments ->
        Movienight: Stream info here | Any | number | of | segments
